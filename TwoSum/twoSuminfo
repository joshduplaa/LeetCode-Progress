Intuition
Two Sum is a problem that needs to be solved by iterating through the list and comparing the complement with values in a hashtable where we are storing the numbers already iterated and the index of those numbers. The complement is the current number being iterated minus the target.
So complement = num-target. If complement is in seenNums, we have found a solution.
return nothing if there's no solution.

Approach
Start by initializing a hashtable for seen numbers, and initializing indexCount, which will be the value in the this key-value pair. The key will be the current num being iterated.

Start iterating throught the list provided, find the current complement, evaluate the condition of complement being in the seenNum hashtable, and return the indexCount and the index of the complement.
If the conditiion is never reached during the iterations, return an empty list.
That's how it's done it python, so easy!
